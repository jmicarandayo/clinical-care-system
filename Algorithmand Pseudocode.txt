Algorithm
1. Patient enters the clinic
2. Ask if the patient is new or has previous records
3. If new, proceed to get personal details(Full Name, Age, Gender, Address, Contact and etc.)
4. Get the priority number then wait,
5. If priority number is the same as the called number then go to the doctor
6. If not, wait until the priority number is the same as the called number
7. The doctor checks and provide consultation
8. Check if the consultation is done
9. If not, continue checkup
10. If yes, update the details
11. End


Pseudocode
BEGIN
NUMERIC pNumber status(old or new) cNumber
OUTPUT("Are you a new patient?")
INPUT status(yes or no)
IF yes (provide form for personal details for new account then get priority Number)
ELSE ( proceed in getting the priority number)
OUTPUT/Generate(pNumber)
FOR (cNumber=(1 to 100))
IF pNumber = cNumber( proceed to the doctor)
ELSE (wait)
IF done checkup (update database)
ELSE (continue checkup)
INPUT (update the database)
